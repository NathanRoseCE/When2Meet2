# When2Meet2
Github Practices
When you are working work in a feature/[featurename] branch that you make
When you are finished with it, merge into devel
MASTER is restricted to working and tested code only and Nathan is the only one able to merge to that branch

When2Meet2
The goal of this project is to create a newer version of when to meet
